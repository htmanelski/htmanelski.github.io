# About Me

![Profile Picture](/assets/images/your-photo.jpg){: width="200" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"}

I am a PhD student at **Purdue University**, studying planetary science. I am interested in using geochemical data collected from the surfaces of rocky planets to better understand their formation and development. My current research focuses on the geochemistry of the Moon and Mars using in-situ **Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)** and **X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)**.

I am a member of the **Perseverance Mars rover science team** since 2022 and specialize in the processing and interpretation of spectral data used to quantify the abundance of chemical elements. My technical expertise includes programming (**Python, C++**), machine learning (**Random Forest, Elastic Net, Gradient Boosting**), and laboratory skills (**lasers, mechano-optics, spectrometers**). Previously, I worked with **VNIR spectral data** from the ChemCam instrument on the **Curiosity Mars rover**. I graduated with a **BSc in Applied Mathematics** from Columbia University in 2022.
