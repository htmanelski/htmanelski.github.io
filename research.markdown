   *Spectrochimica Acta Part B: Atomic Spectroscopy*, Vol 111.

Description: Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) uses a pulsed laser to ablate a target and create a plasma, which emits light at element-specific wavelengths as it cools. This enables rapid, remote quantification of geologic compositions. On Mars, the Curiosity rover’s ChemCam and Perseverance rover’s SuperCam instruments have applied LIBS to build the most comprehensive planetary geochemical dataset ever acquired in situ. In this study, we show that LIBS plasmas generated by SuperCam retain consistent physical properties over distances up to 8 meters, a critical validation step for accurate major-element calibration. These results strengthen confidence in SuperCam’s ability to deliver reliable geochemistry across diverse Martian targets. As lead author, I conceived the study, developed the methodology, performed the interpretation, and wrote the manuscript with contributions from co-authors.

   *Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets*, Volume 128.

Description: Alongside LIBS spectra, which yield elemental abundances, the Curiosity rover’s ChemCam also collects passive reflectance observations for calibration. These provide complementary information on target mineralogy but had been largely overlooked. In this work, we compared ChemCam passive spectra across the Murray Formation, a vast sequence of rocks deposited in an ancient Gale Crater lake. We found strong variability in Fe³⁺ signatures, indicating shifts in aqueous chemistry on early Mars. Consistent with CheMin XRD, ChemCam spectra did not support a significant hematite increase in the Vera Rubin Ridge, contrary to orbital predictions. As lead author, I conceived the study, developed the methodology, interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript with input from co-authors.

   Ore-Grade Nickel Co-located with Redox-Organic Interactions in Neretva Vallis Mudstones, Mars.

Description: I used spectral data from the SuperCam and PIXL instruments on NASA’s Perseverance rover to discover and characterize the highest concentrations of nickel (Ni) ever observed in Martian bedrock. Using machine learning, I quantified enrichments up to 1.2 wt.% in fine-grained sedimentary rocks that also contain organic matter and macroscopic “potential biosignatures” (Hurowitz et al. 2025). The detection of abundant Ni, an essential component of enzymes for ancient microbial life on Earth, strengthens the case for prebiotic chemistry on early Mars. As lead author, I developed the research concept, built the calibration and data pipeline, interpreted results, and wrote the manuscript with input from co-authors. This work was submitted for publication in June 2025 and was accepted for publication in January 2026.
